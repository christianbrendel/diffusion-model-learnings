# ðŸ“š Diffusion Model Learnings ðŸ“š

Here I am documenting my learning notes and little experiments about diffusion models.

### ðŸ§ª Experiments

In the notebooks folder you will find a few notebooks the following topics:

- Notebooks about the some basics
- Notebooks about Stable Diffusion and a copy of the corresponding [repo](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion)
- Notebooks about the [diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) from Hugging Face. 

To play around with the notebooks create the two conda environments from `environment_stable_diffusion.yaml` and `environment_diffusers.yaml` using `conda env create --file <path-to-yaml>`. Use the first environment for all notebooks about the basics and stable diffusion and the latter one for the notebooks on the diffusers library. For the notebooks about stable diffusion (without using diffusors) download the model checkpoint from [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1) and put it into the notebooks folder.
